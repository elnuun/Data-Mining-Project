# Data-Mining-Project
This work was done by Nuno Pais, Diogo Gon√ßalves and Henrique Costa, as part of our Data Mining course at NOVA Information Management School, Lisbon, Portugal. 
The project is subdivided in 3 distinct Jupyter notebooks for memory efficiency purposes. They should be run, naturally, in order, Preprocessing Part 1, Preprocessing Part 2 and 
Clustering Part 3. Associated with the code, there will be a pdf. file available which is the Final Report itself, detailing every methodology employed and conclusions found.
The dataset contained information regarding donors of the Paralyzed Veterans of America and the attempt was to understand and cluster those indiduals, allowing for relevant marketing
campaigns.
